Keep in mind that opening the device will void its warranty. Our vibes contain a lithium-ion battery which needs to be removed and should not be thrown away with household waste. To remove the battery, peel away the silicone cover, open the plastic shell, and remove the battery to be disposed of by your local environmental regulations. Wear gloves during this process for your safety. Once you have carefully discarded your item, we have plenty more fun vibes that await you!<\/h6><h6>For the lubricants and gels, we advise you to rinse the bottle thoroughly once you have finished with it, peel the label off, separate the cap and bottle, and place them in your recycling bin. <\/h6><h6><strong><br\/>WARRANTY<\/strong><\/h6><h6>We stand by the quality of all our Pleasure Products. Should you have any issue with your Vibes Only purchase, please check out our product support FAQ.<\/h6><h6>If this does not solve the problem, please follow the instructions to complete a warranty claim.<\/h6><h6>Vibes Only products are intended for adults only. Our products are of the highest quality and come with a 1-year worldwide manufacturing warranty after the date of original purchase, against defects due to faulty workmanship or materials.

It does NOT cover cosmetic deterioration caused by fair wear and tear or damage caused by accident, misuse or neglect. Any attempt to open or take apart the pleasure object (or its accessories) will void the warranty.<\/h6><h6>Claims under warranty must be supported by reasonable evidence that the date of the claim is within the warranty period. To validate your warranty you must provide us with your order details (name, email address or order number).<\/h6><h6>Once your return is approved, pleasure products under warranty claim must be returned to Vibes Only <strong>with your order details - otherwise, we will not know who to attribute the return to<\/strong>.

While we recommend connecting your Vibes Only vibrator(s) to the app for the best experience, you can absolutely use the app without a device.<strong><br\/><br\/><\/strong><\/h6><h6><strong>How does the app connect with my vibe?<br\/><\/strong>All of our devices are Bluetooth enabled, and will work with any smartphone (iPhone or Android). The Vibes Only app is required to connect to the device. Bluetooth will need to be enabled. Click on “'Vibes\" within the app menu to begin the connection to your device and follow the prompts. If your device is having trouble connecting, we advise troubleshooting with the below steps: · If your bluetooth is enabled on your phone, you must also allow Bluetooth access when you download the Vibes Only app. · If you accidentally declined, you will need to enable Bluetooth for the app by going to \"Settings\" on your phone. Scroll down until you get to the Vibes Only app icon, click into it, and toggle Bluetooth on. Once this is done, restart the app and your vibe may connect. · Please note, you will not find your Vibes Only device under the Bluetooth settings on your phone (i.e. where you would pair your headphones or speakers). You must connect your app and your device in the Vibes Only app itself as we use BLE - lower power Bluetooth).<\/h6><h6><strong>What is the price of the app?<br\/><\/strong>There are two options:<strong><br\/><\/strong>3-day free trial, after which you’ll be billed for the year (at a discounted rate of $49.99)<br\/>$7.99 monthly <\/h6><h6><strong>My vibe isn’t connecting! How can I check everything is working correctly?<br\/><\/strong>If your vibe does not connect with your phone when the button is pressed, here are some simple things to check before you contact us:<\/h6><ul><li><h6>Your vibe battery is drained and requires charging.<\/h6><\/li><li><h6>The Bluetooth on your phone is not enabled. Make sure to enable, or reset your phone if needed.<\/h6><\/li><li><h6>You have exceeded the 10 seconds required for your vibe to ‘find’ a device. Reset both your vibe and your phone by turning off, waiting 30 seconds, then turning on. Now try again making sure your phone has fully restarted, with the bluetooth switched on. Open the Vibes Only app and hold down the power button.<\/h6><\/li><\/ul><h6><strong><br\/>Do you keep any of my data?<br\/><\/strong>The Vibes Only app does not collect or store your personal data within our cloud services.

Any products sold on other sites are counterfeit and will not work with the Vibes Only app.<\/h6><h6><strong>Where are your products made?<br\/><\/strong>Our lubricants and gel products are produced in California, USA. Our vibes are produced in China using the highest manufacturing standards by manufacturers vetted by our partners.<\/h6><h6><strong>What materials are your products made of?<br\/><\/strong>Our vibes are made of body-safe silicone and ABS plastic. They are all latex and phthalate free. Our lubricants and gels are made from body-safe ingredients which are listed on their product page of this website.<\/h6><h6><strong>Do all your vibes come with a charging cable? What if I lost mine?<br\/><\/strong>Yes, all vibes come with a USB charging cable. If you need to order a replacement cable, these can be purchased for a small fee by emailing us at help@vibesonly.com.<\/h6><h6><strong>Which charging adapter do I use with the Vibes Only charging cable?<br\/><\/strong>USB adapters are universal. Depending on the manufacturer, some will take a longer or shorter time to charge (same as if you charge your phone via the computer or a wall charger adapter). Please do not use a high-power charger as it may be too powerful for your vibe, and damage the battery. Smart USB chargers may not function; a standard USB-A outlet is preferred. <\/h6><h6><strong>How do I charge my vibe?<br\/><\/strong>Your vibrators come with a partial charge, but we recommend charging them fully before use. Your instruction manual will indicate where to place your charger on your vibe – it can be via magnet charging clips or through a DC port in the product itself. After the first charge, only charge your vibe when they are empty or very low, to save their battery life. Once you connect your charger, the light on it will flash to indicate it is charging. When the light is steady, the device is fully charged. We also have some great instructional videos available on the Vibes Only app.<\/h6><h6><strong>Help! My vibe isn’t charging.<br\/><\/strong>If your vibrator’s light isn’t pulsing when the charger is connected, this could be why: <\/h6><ul><li><h6>The charging light may be on but sometimes they’re hard to see in a brightly lit room.<\/h6><\/li><li><h6>Battery is already fully charged<\/h6><\/li><li><h6>Battery is drained and will require several minutes to recognize that it is being charged.<\/h6><\/li><li><h6>Charger is not properly connected. Check your charging block and DC jack.<\/h6><\/li><\/ul><h6><strong>Which lubricants should I use with vibes?<br\/><\/strong>You should use a water-based lubricant, such as our Vibes Only Juiced Up. Avoid using a silicone-based lubricant as this could kill your vibe. If you must use a silicone-based lubricant, perform a patch test first. Wash thoroughly after every use.<\/h6><h6>Do not use with oil-based massage oils (such as coconut oil) or oil-based lubricants as it may damage the silicone.<\/h6><h6><strong>How do I care for my vibe?<br\/><\/strong>After every use, clean with warm water and antibacterial soap or toy cleaner. Dry thoroughly with a clean towel or air dry. Store in a cool, dry place and keep your vibe away from toys made of other materials and direct sunlight. Remember to charge periodically to maintain the battery life.<\/h6><h6><strong>Are all your vibes water resistant?<br\/><\/strong>Our vibes are water resistant, not 100% waterproof. This means they’re safe to be rinsed in running water or get a little wet in the shower. Do not fully submerge your vibes, as there is a small chance water may get into the charging port and affect your ability to charge your vibe. <\/h6><h6><strong>What is the shelf life of the lubricant and blow gel?<br\/><\/strong>Our lubricant and blow gel both have a 24 month shelf-life after it was first opened.<\/h6><h6><strong>CONTACT SUPPORT<\/strong><\/h6><h6>Can’t find the answer to your question?
